Quanformer is a Python-based pipeline for generating conformers, preparing quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, and processing QM results for a set of molecules and their conformers.

### Getting started

* Read through `DETAILS.md`.
Eventually this will be transfered over to the [documentation website](https://quanformer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for Quanformer.

* Install Quanformer as a Python module. Find the installation instructions [here](https://quanformer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

* A basic example of how to use quanformer is shown [here](https://quanformer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).


### Developer notes

See big picture to-do items in the issue tracker.
The most immediate things are to transfer all information/details then to import the important tools/utility functions.
